dirfun uses a simple indentation (tab) based syntax to quickly declare directory/file structures.

Keywords `file` and `text` can be used to create files and to write lines to files.

The directories at tab level 0 (no indentation) must be absolute paths.

Relative paths are then declared inside of them.

## Options

```
--editor
nano or vim
For instance --editor=vim

--run
If a script path is provided
it will execute it and exit
```
